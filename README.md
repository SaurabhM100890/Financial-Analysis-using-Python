# Financial Analysis using Python
This project helps to calculate CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model) and other financial indicators with the use of python.
 
1. In this project we will calculate CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model)
   About CAPM-:
   It is a model used in business finance to calculate the expected return on an investment.
   The CAPM formula is used to calculate the cost of equity, which is the rate of return a company pays to equity investors. 
2. Risk free asset and Market portfolio return-:
    Risk-free return is the theoretical return attributed to an investment that provides a guaranteed return with zero risks.
    The risk-free rate of return represents the interest on an investor's money that would be expected from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specified period of time.
   The market portfolio return is the total gain or loss of all assets in the market portfolio. It's a measure of how well the market portfolio is doing at increasing capital.
3. Beta Calculation for Stocks-:
   Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility or systematic risk in relation to the overall market (usually represented by a benchmark index like the S&P 500).
   It helps investors understand how much risk a stock adds to a diversified portfolio.

Beta = 1: The stock moves in line with the market. If the market goes up by 1%, the stock also goes up by 1%, and vice versa.
Beta > 1: The stock is more volatile than the market. For instance, if Beta = 1.5, the stock tends to rise or fall by 1.5% for every 1% movement in the market.
Beta < 1: The stock is less volatile than the market. For example, if Beta = 0.5, the stock moves only 0.5% for every 1% change in the market.
Beta = 0: The stock has no correlation with the market, like cash or unrelated assets.
Negative Beta: The stock moves inversely to the market. For example, gold or certain defensive assets might have negative beta values.
